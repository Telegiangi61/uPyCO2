This repository has the code that helps you to build DIY CO2 measuring devices and connect them to your smartphone. The measurements can be an aid for Covid-19 prevention. Because if there is a lot of exhaled CO2 in the air, there are also a lot of aerosols in the air. These smallest particles to which Sars-CoV-2 viruses from the respiratory tract attach themselves can float in the room air and can spread over several meters. A high concentration of aerosols increases the risk for everyone else in the room to become infected.
